- Hii, I’m @pi-pi-pi-pi-papaya ♡
- ♡ I’m interested in drawing, eating, playing papa games and coding on ToyHouse and Tumblr
- ♡ I’m currently learning Japanese and getting some kind of idea on coding ^^"
- ♡ I don't really know what this is for, all I know is that I was playing Papa's Bakeria and it told me to report a bug when it crashed and now I'm here!
- ♡ How to reach me ... who knows?
- ♡ Pronouns: she/her ♡
- ♡ Fun fact: I LOVE cream cheese in my chocolate drinks that I'd make when I worked as a barista

I'm gonna cry I don't know how to code or make anything work T^T
